# retirement-planner
A free, educational tool that helps explore retirement uncertainty without prediction or pressure. By running thousands of calculations using a well-accepted statistical model, it encourages thoughtful preparation, humility, and perspective rather than fixed answers or advice.
This tool is provided for educational purposes only. It does not offer financial, tax, or legal advice, and it does not recommend specific actions. It is intended to support reflection and understanding, not decision-making.
